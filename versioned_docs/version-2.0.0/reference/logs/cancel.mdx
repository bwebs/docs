# Cancel message

This API allows users to cancel a message that is currently in the process of being delivered.

A well-formatted API call to the cancel message API will return either `200` status code for a successful cancelation or `409` status code for an unsuccessful cancelation. Both cases will include the actual `message` record in the response body (see details below).

# A Note On Successful Cancelations

A successful cancelation will return a  `200` status code along with the updated `message` record in the response body. Because the cancelation was a success, this `message` record will include a status of `CANCELED` as well as a `canceledAt` timestamp.

This successful response with status code `200` communicates a **_soft guarantee_** of message cancelation. It is still possible that the message has actually already been sent and that the `SENT` event is still on its way and has not been processed yet by the Courier Event Log Service. **_This fact will be explicitly communicated in the official API documentation._**

# A Note On `:message_id`

A successful call to `POST /send` returns a `202` status code along with a `requestId` in the response body.

For send requests that have a single recipient, the `requestId` is assigned to the derived message as its `message_id`. Therefore the `requestId` can be supplied to the Message’s API for single recipient messages.

For send requests that have multiple recipients (accounts, audiences, lists, etc.), Courier assigns a unique id to each derived message as its `message_id`. Therefore the `requestId` cannot be supplied to the Message’s API for single-recipient messages. This is a currently a feature gap and will be explained in /send API documentation(https://linear.app/trycourier/issue/C-9704/update-documentation-for-request-id-and-post-send)
