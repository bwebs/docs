# Audiences

The Audiences API helps you build collections of users based on rules. These rules can be as simple as "users in California," but can also be extended to more complex sets of operations. This is different from [lists](/reference/lists) in which the members of the collection are statically defined by subscribe and unsubscribe actions.
