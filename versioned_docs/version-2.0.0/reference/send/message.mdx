# Send a message

Use the send API to send a message to one or more recipients. The send API is very flexible, and has a large number of options available.
Most of these are optional, and can be ignored unless you want to override the default behavior.

You are required to specify a `to` with at least one recipient. You must also specify either `template` or `content`.

<ApiReference {...config} />

## Example

This example uses an existing notification template, and sends to a user by ID.
We don't need to specify any other configuration or settings, since we will use the defaults.
We don't need to provide any additional information about the user either, since we can rely
on the user profile data already stored with Courier to customize the message.

Method: `POST`

URL: `https://api.courier.com/send`

Body:
​

```json
{
  "message": {
    "to": {
      "user_id": "a1b2c3d4"
    },
    "template": "abcdef12345678"
  }
}
```

## Example

This example uses an existing notification template, but overrides the template's `routing` to force the message to be sent by email.
The user's email is specified in the `to` field, while the user's name appears in the `data` field. This makes the variable `name` available to the template for inclusion in the text of the message.

Method: `POST`

URL: `https://api.courier.com/send`

Body:
​

```json
{
  "message": {
    "to": {
      "email": "hello@example.com"
    },
    "template": "abcdef12345678",
    "data": {
      "name": "John Doe"
    },
    "routing": {
      "method": "single",
      "channels": ["email"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Example

This example uses an existing notification template, and sends to multiple recipients: 2 lists and an audience.

Method: `POST`

URL: `https://api.courier.com/send`

Body:

```json
{
  "message": {
    "to": [
      {
        "list_id": "LI56789"
      },
      {
        "list_id": "LI12345"
      },
      {
        "audience_id": "AUD334455"
      }
    ],
    "template": "abcdef12345678"
  }
}
```

## Send Response Data

Sending a message is an async process. So upon submission of a message,
only a requestId will be returned.

```json
{ "requestId": "1-6486479a-fbc8dd2cb356b1d8b4bb95a5" }
```

### RequestId Details

#### Single-Recipient Message Requests

For send requests that have a single, end user, recipient, the `requestId` is assigned to the derived message as its `message_id`.
Therefore the `requestId` can be supplied to the Message’s API for single recipient messages. Therefore the `requestId` can be
supplied to the Message's API via the `messageId` query parameter. i.e. `https://api.courier.com/messages?messageId=1-6486479a-fbc8dd2cb356b1d8b4bb95a5`

Here is an example of a `POST /send` request body that contains a single-recipient message:

```json
{
  "message": {
    "to": {
      "email": "marty@backtothefuture.com"
    },
    "content": {
      "title": "TEST",
      "body": "TEST"
    },
    "routing": {
      "method": "single",
      "channels": ["email"]
    }
  }
}
```

Given this request, Courier responds with a `200` status code and the following response body:

```json
{ "requestId": "1-6486479a-fbc8dd2cb356b1d8b4bb95a5" }
```

To obtain the derived message, its individual message id and current delivery status from this request, use the `messageId` query parameter on the Message's API.

```
GET https://api.courier.com/messages?messageId=1-6486479a-fbc8dd2cb356b1d8b4bb95a5
```

#### Multi-Recipient Message Requests

For send requests that have multiple recipients (accounts, audiences, lists, etc.), Courier assigns a unique id to each derived
message as its `message_id`. Therefore the `requestId` can only be supplied to the Message's API via the `listMessageId` query parameter.

Here is an example of a `POST /send` request body that contains a multi-recipient message:

```json
{
  "message": {
    "to": [
      {
        "email": "marty@backtothefuture.com"
      },
      {
        "email": "doc_brown@backtothefuture.com"
      },
      {
        "email": "biff@backtothefuture.com"
      }
    ],
    "content": {
      "title": "TEST",
      "body": "TEST"
    },
    "routing": {
      "method": "single",
      "channels": ["email"]
    }
  }
}
```

Given this request, Courier responds with a `200` status code and the following response body:

```json
{ "requestId": "1-6486479a-fbc8dd2cb356b1d8b4bb95a5" }
```

To obtain all derived messages, their individual message id's and current delivery statuses from this request, use the `listMessageId` query parameter on the Message's API.

```
GET https://api.courier.com/messages?listMessageId=1-6486479a-fbc8dd2cb356b1d8b4bb95a5
```

### Custom Formatting

To improve working with cURL, Courier also supports a custom urlencoded format that can be used in the place of JSON.
This format allows nested data values using square bracket syntax. This is useful when passing `profile` and `data` parameters.
For example, a cURL `--data` option with the `profile` parameter and a nested `email` would look like this:

```bash
--data "profile[email]=test@example.com"
```
