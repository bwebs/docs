# Send a message

Use the send API to send a message to one or more recipients.

**Base URL:** `https://api.courier.com`

**Path:** `/send`

**Method:** `POST`

```json
{
  "message": {
    "to": {
      "email": "darth@vader.com"
    },
    "content": {
      "title": "Why did Anakin cross the road??",
      "body": "To get to the dark side."
    }
  }
}
```

## Request Body

The `POST` accepts a JSON payload with a single message property.

<Params>
  <Param name="message" type="Message" required>
    Defines the message to be delivered
    <ChildParams name="message object">
      <Message />
    </ChildParams>
  </Param>
</Params>

### The Message Property

The `message` property has the following primary top-level properties. They define the destination and content of the message.

Additional advanced configuration fields [are defined below](#other-message-properties).

<Message />

### The To Property

**Required.** The recipient or recipients or this message.

Example of sending to a single recipient:

```json
"to": {
	"email": "darth@vader.com"
}
```

Example of sending to multiple recipients:

```json
"to": [
	{
		"email": "darth@vader.com"
	},
	{
		"email": "luke@skywalker.com"
	}
]
```

<ToProfile />

### The Content Property

Describes the content of the message in a way that will work for email, push, chat, or any channel. Either this field or template must be specified.

```json
"content": {
	"title": "Why did Anakin cross the road?",
	"body": "To get to the dark side!"
}
```

<Content />

### The Data Property

An arbitrary object that includes any data you want to pass to the message. The data can be used to populate corresponding template/content variables or be passed-through to your application via the Courier client SDKs.

```json
"data": {
  "real_name": "Anakin Skywalker",
  "nickname": "Darth Vader",
  "category": "villain"
}
```

### Other Message Properties

The following properties support overriding configured values and defaults at run-time and attaching metadata to messages.

<AdvancedMessageProperties />

### The Channels Property

An object whose keys are valid channel identifiers (email, sms, etc) which map to an object with the following properties.

```json
"channels": {
	"sms": {
		"brand_id": "xxx"
	}
}
```

<ChannelConfig />

### The Expiry Property

Expiry allows you to set an absolute or relative time in which a message expires.

Note: This is only valid for the Courier Inbox channel as of 12-08-2022.

<Expiry />

### The Metadata Property

Attach information not related to the content of the message for application or marketing use cases.

<Metadata />

### The Providers Property

An object whose keys are valid provider identifiers which map to an object with the following properties:

```json
"providers": {
  "slack": {
    "if": "profile.locale === 'en-us'"
  }
}
```

<ProviderConfig />

### The Routing Property

Allows you to customize which channel(s) Courier will potentially deliver the message. If no
routing key is specified, Courier will use the default routing configuration or routing
defined by the template.

<Routing />

#### As an Array of Channel Identifiers

The simplest option is to specify an array of strings that match the Channel identifies you want to use to send the message.

In this example, courier will send to one of sms, email or inbox depending of user preferences.

```json
"routing": {
  "method": "single",
  "channels": ["sms", "email", "inbox"]
}
```

#### Advanced Routing Strategy

The routing property can be used to define advanced routing scenarios. In this example, we send a
push notification to both the user's Apple and Android devices. If sending via push fails, we
send an sms instead.

```json
"routing": {
  "method": "single",
  "channels": [
    {
      "method": "all",
      "channels": ["apn", "firebase-fcm"]
    },
    "sms"
  ]
}
```

**Note:** Automated failover is a **business tier feature**.
