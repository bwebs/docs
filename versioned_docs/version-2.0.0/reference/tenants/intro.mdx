The Tenants API is designed to enable multi-tenant notification workflows. This is useful for defining user to tenant level relationships, especially in the context of B2B applications.

Use Cases:

- Sending branded notifications on behalf of a tenant
- Creating slack-bots on behalf of a tenant

## Usage in a send call

```js
POST https://api.courier.com/send

{
  message: {
    template: "my_template",
    to: {
      user_id: "person",
      tenant_id: "ACME"
    }
  }
}
```
