# Scheduling

Courier Automations can offers the ability to be invoked on a schedule. This can be useful
for scheduling a notification to be sent periodically.

To setup a scheduled automation, drag over the Schedule trigger from the triggers section
onto the canvas. `Publishing` an automation template is sufficient to allow the trigger to invoke the automation on the provided schedule. You **do not** need to make a separate API call to invoke.

Courier offers three scheduling methods:

1. Recurrence, schedule the automation to be invoked on a repeated schedule. Similar to how
   one would schedule a repeat event in their favorite calendar application.
2. Date, schedule the automation to be invoked one time on a specific future date.
3. Cron. Similar to Recurrence but with more specificity using [crontab expressions](https://crontab.guru/).
