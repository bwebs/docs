# SDK Libraries

You can access our REST API and integrate Courier into your application using one of our [server SDK](/sdk-libraries/server-sdks) libraries.

The Courier Platform included embeddable [Inbox](/platform/inbox) and [Preference](/platform/preferences) components and [client SDKs](/sdk-libraries/client-sdks) for web, iOS and Android.
