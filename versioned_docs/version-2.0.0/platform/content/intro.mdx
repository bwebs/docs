There are two ways that developers can construct the content of the notifications that they send:

* Elemental - a JSON syntax used when invoking the [Send API](/reference/send)
* Templates - designed using our web-based editor 

Both of these approaches support the ability to design content that is tailored to the channel it is being delivered to (sms, email, push, etc).
