# Users

Courier uses the term `user` to describe the recipient of a notification. You'll sometimes see the term `recipient` used, but these mean the same thing. There are several different ways to define which users will recieve a notification. 

The code samples below illustrate a subset of the `message` object used to make a call to the [send API](../../reference/send).

## Inline

The simplest way to send a notification is to specify either an `email` or a `phone_number`.

```json
"to": {
    "email": "luke@skywalker.com"
}
```

## Profiles

Courier supports storing user contact information in a [Profile](../../reference/profiles) record, and then referencing a `user_id` when calling `send`. One of the benefits of this approach is that the specific channel that is used to deliver the notification can be deferred to a later step where routing rules are applied. 

```json
"to": {
    "user_id": "luke1234"
}
```

## Lists

If you want to send a notification to more than one user, you can add as many users as you like to a [List](../../reference/lists) and then pass the `list_id`.

```json
"to": {
    "list_id": "rebel_alliance"
}
```

## Audiences

```json
"to": {
    "audience_id": ""
}
```

## Accounts

```json
"to": {
    "user_id": "luke1234",
    "account_id" : "hoth"
}
```
