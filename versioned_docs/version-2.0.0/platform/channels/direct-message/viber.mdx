# Viber

## Viber Requirements

1. An active viber account logged into either the iOS or Android app.
2. A Viber bot. A bot can be created [here](https://partners.viber.com/account/create-bot-account). Make a note of the auth token, referred throughout this document as `VIBER_AUTH_TOKEN`.
3. An active webhooks server that can receive POST requests from Viber. Viber provides a nodejs utility for handling these requests [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/viber-bot).

## Webhooks Server.

Before sending notifications Viber requires a webhooks server to be registered. This can be done using the following cURL command:

```bash
 curl -X POST 'https://chatapi.viber.com/pa/set_webhook'\
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json'\
      -H 'X-Viber-Auth-Token: <VIBER_AUTH_TOKEN>'\
      -d '{ "url": "<YOUR_WEBHOOK_SERVER_URL>", "event_types": ["delivered"] }'
```

This webhooks server will receive events including UserID's of users who wish to subscribe and notification delivery status events. These events are documented [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/viber-bot).

## Sending a Direct Message

To send a direct message to a user, supply the `UserID` to the `"reciever"` field of the Viber profile object. This `UserID` is sent to the webhooks server after they send a message to the Viber bot.

```js
{
  "message": {
    // Recipient Profile
    "to": {
      "viber": {
        "receiver": "12943673=="
      }
    }
  }
}
```
