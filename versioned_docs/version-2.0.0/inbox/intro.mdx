# Courier Inbox

Courier Inbox is a set of APIs and SDKs that make it easy to add a modern notification inbox to your web or mobile application.

Inbox is available for web, iOS and Android applications and is fully customizable, so you can tailor the look and feel of to match your app's branding and style. You can also configure Inbox to work alongside other messaging channels that you use, including email, SMS, push notifications, and more.  For example, if you send a notification to both the `inbox` and `email` channels and the user opens the email, their Inbox notification will be marked as read.

## Key Features

Inbox includes a number of key features, such as:

- Send notifications using a single, simple REST API.
- Support for web, iOS and Android apps.
- New notifications are delivered in realtime over our websocket infrastructure.
- Unread notification counts.
- Events triggers when notifications are delivered/opened and when users mark notifications as read.

## Live Demo

Check out a live demo of Inbox for Web at: [https://reactinappnotification.com](https://reactinappnotification.com).

## The Legacy Push Channel

- There is no plan sunset the legacy `push` channel, but feature development has stopped.
- New features will only be built into the Inbox channel.
- Customers who had the Courier provider configured prior to the launch of the Inbox channel will see both Push and Inbox.
- Customers can have a mix of Inbox and Push in their workspace without any problems.
- We encourage customers to build new notifications using Inbox moving forward
